# Static Facial Emotion Prediction (Happy vs Sad)

This project is a deep learning-based facial emotion classification system that predicts whether a person is **happy** or **sad** from static images. The model is trained on facial expression data and built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- Binary classification: **Happy** vs **Sad**
- Preprocessing with OpenCV (grayscale conversion, resizing)
- CNN-based architecture with dropout and data augmentation
- Evaluation using accuracy, loss plots, and confusion matrix

##  Model Architecture

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

- 3 convolutional blocks (Conv2D + MaxPooling2D)
- Flatten layer
- Dense layers with Dropout
- Output layer with sigmoid activation

## Results

- Accuracy: ~**97.5%** (replace with your final accuracy)

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow  
- Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
