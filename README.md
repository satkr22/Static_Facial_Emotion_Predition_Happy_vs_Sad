# Static Facial Emotion Prediction (Happy vs Sad)

This project is a deep learning-based facial emotion classification system that predicts whether a person is **happy** or **sad** from static images. The model is trained on facial expression data and built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Features

- Binary classification: **Happy** vs **Sad**
- Preprocessing with OpenCV (grayscale conversion, resizing)
- CNN-based architecture with dropout and data augmentation
- Evaluation using accuracy, loss plots, and confusion matrix

##  Model Architecture

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the following layers:

- 3 convolutional blocks (Conv2D + MaxPooling2D)
- Flatten layer
- Dense layers with Dropout
- Output layer with sigmoid activation

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/satkr22/Static_Facial_Emotion_Predition_Happy_vs_Sad.git
cd Static_Facial_Emotion_Predition_Happy_vs_Sad
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the notebook**
Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
```bash
jupyter notebook Emotion_detection.ipynb
```

## Results

- Accuracy: ~**97.5%** (replace with your final accuracy)
- Confusion Matrix and Accuracy/Loss curves are available in `saved_plots/`

##  Sample Prediction

You can test images from the `test_images/` folder in the notebook and view predictions.
